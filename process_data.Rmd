## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
CAN_tibble <- CAN %>% as_tibble
CAN_tibble
```

```{r}
CAN_tibble %>% mutate(title = as.character(title),
                      channel_title = as.character(channel_title),
                      description = as.character(description),
                      tags = as.character(tags),
                      thumbnail_link = as.character(thumbnail_link))
```


```{r}
CAN_tibble %>% mutate(trending_date = as.character(trending_date) %>% 
                        as.Date("%y.%d.%m"))
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
CAN_tibble %>% mutate(publish_time = as.character(publish_time) %>%
                        str_replace("T", " ") %>%
                        str_remove("Z") %>% 
                        as.POSIXct(format = "%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
